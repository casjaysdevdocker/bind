echo ""
echo "üìã Solution Summary:"
echo "-------------------"
echo "‚úÖ Enhanced __start_init_scripts function:"
echo "   - Better error handling with immediate container exit on service failures"  
echo "   - Improved service verification after startup"
echo "   - Detailed logging and status reporting"
echo "   - Proper cleanup of stale PID files on restart"

echo ""
echo "‚úÖ Enhanced __no_exit function (service supervisor):"  
echo "   - Continuous monitoring of all services"
echo "   - Configurable failure thresholds (default: 3 failures per service)"
echo "   - Container termination when critical services fail"
echo "   - Periodic status logging"
echo "   - Graceful cleanup on container shutdown"

echo ""
echo "‚úÖ Fixed container restart issues:"
echo "   - Stale PID files are cleaned up on restart"
echo "   - Services restart properly after container restart"
echo "   - No more 'zombie' containers that appear running but have dead services"

echo ""
echo "üîß Key Improvements Made:"
echo "------------------------"
echo "1. Modified entrypoint.sh to clean stale PIDs on restart"
echo "2. Enhanced __start_init_scripts with better error handling and exit codes"
echo "3. Replaced __no_exit with a proper service supervisor"
echo "4. Added comprehensive service monitoring with configurable thresholds"
echo "5. Ensured container exits when critical services fail (allowing orchestrator restart)"

echo ""
echo "‚öôÔ∏è  Configuration Options:"
echo "-------------------------"
echo "Environment variables you can set to customize behavior:"
echo "‚Ä¢ SERVICES_LIST: Comma-separated list of services to monitor (default: tini,named,nginx,php-fpm)"
echo "‚Ä¢ SERVICE_CHECK_INTERVAL: How often to check services in seconds (default: 30)"  
echo "‚Ä¢ MAX_SERVICE_FAILURES: Max failures before terminating container (default: 3)"

echo ""
echo "üéØ Expected Behavior:"
echo "--------------------"
echo "‚Ä¢ Container starts and initializes all services"
echo "‚Ä¢ If any service fails to start, container exits immediately"  
echo "‚Ä¢ Once running, supervisor monitors all services continuously"
echo "‚Ä¢ If any service dies and exceeds failure threshold, container exits"
echo "‚Ä¢ On container restart, all services start fresh (no stale state)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Orchestrator (Docker/Kubernetes) can restart failed containers automatically"

echo ""
echo "üìù Files Modified/Created:"
echo "-------------------------"
echo "‚Ä¢ rootfs/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh (PID cleanup logic)"
echo "‚Ä¢ rootfs/usr/local/etc/docker/functions/entrypoint.sh (enhanced functions)"

echo ""
echo "üöÄ To apply this solution to all repositories:"
echo "---------------------------------------------"
echo "1. Copy the enhanced functions file to each repo's rootfs/usr/local/etc/docker/functions/"
echo "2. Apply the entrypoint.sh PID cleanup changes to each repo's entrypoint.sh"
echo "3. Rebuild and test your containers"

echo ""
echo "‚ú® Testing completed! The solution should resolve both issues:"
echo "   - Services will restart properly after container restarts"
echo "   - Containers will exit (die) when critical services fail"
